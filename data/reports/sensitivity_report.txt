LedgerX – Sensitivity Analysis Report
=====================================

Model path used: models\best_model_tuned.pkl

Includes:
- Top feature importance bar chart (feature_importance.png)
- Global SHAP summary plot (shap_summary.png)

Interpretation guidance:
- Features with higher importance (or larger absolute SHAP values) have a stronger
  influence on the model's predictions.
- Use the SHAP summary plot to see which features consistently push predictions
  toward failure vs. success, and whether any features behave unexpectedly.
